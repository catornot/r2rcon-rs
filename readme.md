# r2rcon-rs
rcon spcec implementation in rust for r2northstar

should work

## setup

rcon will pull configs from commandline args.

| **command line arg** | **value**    |
| :------------------: | :----------: |
| `rcon_ip_port`       | ip:port      |
| `rcon_password`      | ascii string |

if any of these are missed the plugin will panic :p

after it works just connect with a rcon client

good luck!
