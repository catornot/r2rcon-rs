# r2rcon-rs
rcon spcec implementation in rust for r2northstar

should work

## setup

rcon will pull configs from commandline args.

| **command line arg** | **value**    |
| :------------------: | :----------: |
| rcon_ip_port         | ip:port      |
| rcon_password        | ascii string |

if any of these are missed the plugin will panic :p

after it works just connect with a rcon client

good luck!
